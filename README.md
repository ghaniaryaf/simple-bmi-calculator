## ✨ Features

### 🔢 **Multiple BMI Formulas**
- **Standard BMI** - Traditional formula used worldwide
- **WHO Adjusted** - Age and gender-adjusted calculations
- **New Formula** - Advanced height-corrected calculation

### 👤 **Personalized Calculations**
- **Gender-specific** - Different calculations for males/females
- **6 Age Stages** - From infants to elderly (0-2, 2-12, 13-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60+)
- **Unit Conversion** - Switch between metric (kg/cm) and imperial (lbs/inches)

### 📊 **Detailed Results**
- BMI score with color-coded categories
- Health risk assessment
- Personalized recommendations
- Age-stage visualization
- Calculation method explanation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- React 18+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmi-calculator.git
cd bmi-calculator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🧮 Calculation Methods

### 1. **Standard BMI**
```
BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)²
```
- Most widely used formula
- Same for all ages and genders

### 2. **WHO Adjusted BMI**
```
Adjusted BMI = Standard BMI × Age Factor × Gender Factor
```
- Accounts for age and gender differences
- Better accuracy for children and elderly

### 3. **New BMI Formula**
```
New BMI = 1.3 × weight (kg) / height (m)²·⁵
```
- Addresses height bias in standard formula
- Better for very tall or short individuals

## 👶 Age Stages Classification

| Age Range | Stage | Special Considerations |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|
| 0-2 years | Infant | WHO growth chart based |
| 2-12 years | Child | CDC percentiles (5th-95th) |
| 13-19 years | Teen | Growth patterns monitored |
| 20-39 years | Young Adult | Peak health assessment |
| 40-59 years | Adult | Metabolic health focus |
| 60+ years | Elder | Geriatric health guidelines |

## 📈 BMI Categories

### Adults (20+ years)
| BMI Range | Category | Color | Health Risk |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| < 18.5 | Underweight | 🔵 Blue | Nutritional deficiency |
| 18.5-24.9 | Normal | 🟢 Green | Low risk |
| 25-29.9 | Overweight | 🟡 Yellow | Moderate risk |
| ≥ 30 | Obese | 🔴 Red | High risk |

### Children/Teens (2-19 years)
| Percentile | Category | Interpretation |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| < 5th | Underweight | Below normal growth |
| 5th-84th | Healthy weight | Normal growth pattern |
| 85th-94th | Overweight | Monitor growth |
| ≥ 95th | Obese | High weight for age |

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Functional Components** with Hooks
- **Inline CSS** for styling
- **Clean Architecture** with separation of concerns

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each component has one job
2. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript implementation
3. **Performance** - Memoized calculations where needed
4. **Accessibility** - Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation
5. **Responsive Design** - Works on mobile and desktop

### State Management
```typescript
// Main state variables
const [weight, setWeight] = useState<string>('');
const [height, setHeight] = useState<string>('');
const [age, setAge] = useState<string>('');
const [gender, setGender] = useState<'male' | 'female'>('male');
const [calculationMethod, setCalculationMethod] = useState<'standard' | 'who' | 'new'>('standard');
const [unit, setUnit] = useState<'metric' | 'imperial'>('metric');
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

The calculator is fully responsive and works on:
- 📱 Mobile phones (320px and up)
- 💻 Tablets (768px and up)
- 🖥️ Desktop (1024px and up)

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Unit tests for calculation functions
- Component rendering tests
- User interaction tests
- Edge case validations

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Age Categories
Edit `ageCategories` in `types/bmiTypes.ts`:
```typescript
{ min: 60, max: 200, label: 'Senior (60+)' }
```

### Adding New Calculation Methods
1. Add method to `calculationMethods` array
2. Implement function in `bmiCalculations.ts`
3. Add case in `calculateBMI` function

### Styling Customization
Modify inline styles in components or create CSS modules:
```typescript
// Add to BMICalculator.tsx
import styles from './BMICalculator.module.css';
```
